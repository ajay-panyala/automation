<h1>Principal's Message</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px">It gives me immense pleasure to welcome all those who aspire to have a career in engineering; a fruitful stay at our institute At IIET, we have a student friendly environment with all facilities including well equipped departments, qualified and experienced faculty. We at IIET, seek to define the moral obligation of the engineer using traditional moral philosophy and describe how this obligation might be translated into a more positive definition of success. The programs offered by the institute prepare students for careers in industry or for post graduate study in engineering or related fields.</p>
